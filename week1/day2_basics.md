## Linux Navigation Basics: Basic Commands

Linux Navigation Basics is about using simple commands to move around and manage files on your computer. 
For example, cd lets you go into different folders, ls shows you what files and folders are inside, and pwd tells you where you are 
currently. These commands help you easily find and organize your files.

# Change directory
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

# Lists files and directories in the current directory.
```bash
ls
```

# View current working directory
```bash
pwd
```
# Displays the mannual page for a command
```bash
man ls
```
