## **Beginner Tasks**
1. **Navigation & File Management**
   - Create a directory called `my_project` inside the home folder.
   - Inside `my_project`, create three text files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.
   - Write "Hello World" into `file1.txt` using the `echo` command.
   - Copy `file1.txt` to `file1_backup.txt`.
   - Move `file2.txt` to a new directory called `backup`.

2. **File Permissions & Ownership**
   - Change permissions of `file1.txt` to **read & write for the owner, read for others**.
   - Change the owner of `file1_backup.txt` to another user.
   - Set `file3.txt` to be **executable** for all users.

3. **Viewing and Editing Files**
   - Use `nano` or `vim` to edit `file1.txt` and add some text.
   - Use `cat` to display the content of `file1.txt`.
   - Use `head` to show the first 5 lines of `file1.txt`.
   - Use `tail` to show the last 5 lines of `file1.txt`.

4. **Searching for Files & Text**
   - Find all `.txt` files inside `my_project`.
   - Search for the word "Hello" inside `file1.txt` using `grep`.
   - Count the number of lines in `file1.txt`.
