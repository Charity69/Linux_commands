### **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) in Linux**

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is an essential protocol for managing and automating IP address assignments in a network. In Linux, it simplifies network management by dynamically allocating IP addresses and providing additional configuration details such as DNS servers, gateway addresses, and more.

### **How DHCP Works**
1. **Client Request**: A client device sends a broadcast request (DHCPDISCOVER) asking for an IP address.
2. **Server Offer**: A DHCP server responds with an available IP address (DHCPOFFER).
3. **Client Acceptance**: The client accepts the offer by sending a DHCPREQUEST message.
4. **Server Acknowledgment**: The server confirms the lease by sending a DHCPACK message.

### **Setting Up a DHCP Server in Linux**

#### **1. Installation**
On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):  
```bash
sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
```

#### **2. Configuration**
After installation, configure the DHCP server by editing its main configuration file:  
```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

**Basic Configuration Example:**
```conf
# Define the subnet and its IP range
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
    option routers 192.168.1.1;        # Default gateway
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4; # DNS servers
    option domain-name "example.com"; # Domain name
    default-lease-time 600;           # Lease duration in seconds
    max-lease-time 7200;              # Maximum lease duration
}
```

Save and close the file after editing.

#### **3. Restart the DHCP Service**
To apply changes, restart the DHCP service:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
```

#### **4. Verify the Configuration**
Check for errors in the configuration:  
```bash
sudo dhcpd -t
```

### **Key Points to Remember**
- **Static IP for Server**: Ensure the DHCP server itself has a static IP address for stable operation.
- **Leases**: DHCP leases are temporary. The lease duration determines how long a device can use the assigned IP.
- **Logs**: Monitor logs for DHCP activity:  
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog
  ```

### **DHCP Client on Linux**
To configure a Linux machine as a DHCP client:  
1. Open the network configuration file, typically located in `/etc/network/interfaces` (Debian-based) or `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` (Red Hat-based).
2. Set the interface to use DHCP:  

**Example (Debian-based):**
```conf
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

3. Restart the network service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   ```

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
- **No IP Address Assigned**: Verify the DHCP server is running and reachable.
- **Conflict Issues**: Check for overlapping IP ranges in your network.
- **Test Connectivity**: Use `ping`, `ifconfig`, or `ip addr` to verify network settings.
